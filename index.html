            <h2>The maestro of Angst</h2>
            <p><img src="ingmar.jpg" alt="Ingmar Bergman(1918-2007)"></p>
            <p><strong>Through</strong> the group discussion, we analyzed the article ‘Ingmar Bergman: The Maestro of Angst’. In view of Bergman's various works, you will find that he is a very individual filmmaker. The demand for actors and the exploration of the location and theme of photography vividly interpret his notion of seeing movies as art. Bergman is a typical melancholic master in the mid-20th century, and his works all reveal some dark, realistic and gloomy pictures. Like the article said Bergman sees film as "a form of art that goes beyond ordinary consciousness, straight to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls." His pursuit of film details surpasses other filmmakers, and his works can profoundly convey a concept that hits our hearts deeply. Bergman attaches great importance to the position of emotion in the movie, which also reflects his own life. I think the author's main purpose is to interpret his respect for Bergman and his works through his perception and analysis. Through what the article says ‘I know it has become unfashionable to glory in the unique vision of an artist/auteur, but in Bergman's case the exultation is well deserved’, we can guess that the author made a critical analysis of the contrast between other film forms in view of Bergman's non-mainstream film expression. Bergman pursues his own style very much and persists. Many of his works are not popular and have encountered many negative attitudes, but these do not affect his expression of his ideas, which is also one of the keys to his success. On the other hand, his works have great influence and appeal. I think not everyone can understand the meaning of Bergman's works. The work "Persona" is also Bergman's work I admire most. Movies explain dreams and reality from various angles, and different expressive powers reflect various unique art forms. Bergman's style is monotonous and specific, and his works often use dark power to express realistic ideas.
                In the process of understanding Bergman, our group found that Bergman's thoughts were greatly influenced by his tragic childhood, and he always indirectly expressed these negative effects in his works. We can understand these negative factors, but some of the concepts are really distorted and gloomy and can imagine Bergman's childhood, which makes me feel sympathy. The author's main point is to express an attitude towards Bergman's negative film works. Although the author appreciates Bergman's work, these dark, gloomy works will eventually make people uncomfortable. Bergman can represent a way of artistic expression, but this kind of art is too extreme. Bergman wants to express his ideas and thoughts about darkness, pain, and God through different levels. However, not all works are successful, and those imperfect works may bring more negative effects. In addition, combined with the article and the movie, I feel some depression and negativity. It will plunge you into darkness and feel that everything is gray and lifeless. These negative images also reflect the cruelty of reality, which is the special feature of Bergman's movies. The feeling of melancholy is always frustrating, but the characteristics of reality can be seen through movies. Bergman's movies are so direct and real.

            <h2>Nordic film "Insomnia"</h2>
            <p><img src="insomnia.jpg" alt="insomnia(1997)"></p>
            <p><strong>Insomnia</strong> is a 1997 Norweigian thriller movie about a police detective investigating a murder in a town located above the arctic circle. This movie was first produced in 1997 and then was remade 5 years later. 
                The two movies are very similar in a way in that both movies are about a disgraced forensics expert. The comparison of these two movies can be seen as a direct example in comparing nodic movies and commonly seen american tv shows and movies. 
                Stylistically, the two movies are in sharp contrast. The nordic movie opened up with graphic footage of the crime in question, while the american movie started with a cold scene where a latex-gloved-thumb was rubbing at a bloodstained sleeve. 
                It is obvious that the nodic movie has placed a heavy emphasis on setting, as we can tell from the opening. It is even more perpetual throughout the nordic movie itself. 
                The american movie focused on realism while the nordic one set out to make a unique noir with not only light dynamic but the darkness interference when the protagonist was released. 
                Unlike the american successor, the nordic movie did not care much at all for the discovery of the protagonist, in which case, they traded thrills for chills. 
                The movie focused more on the character itself than what is on his way following his exile. The american one has taken a more traditional, narrative-based approach and has tried to weave in more tension while keeping some original setpieces in his movie.
